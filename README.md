# Homework Web Project – JavaScript 

This project is a university homework assignment demonstrating core JavaScript concepts, basic **HTML/CSS layout**, and working with **external APIs**.

The goal of the project is to practice modern JavaScript syntax, modular code structure, and basic asynchronous programming using `fetch`.

---

 Project Overview

The application demonstrates:

-  **modules** (`import / export`)
- JavaScript **functions for array processing**
- **Object merging** using the spread operator
- **Asynchronous API requests** using `fetch`
- Displaying results both in:
  - Browser Developer Console
  - Custom visual console on the web page

---

##  Implemented JavaScript Features

### 1️ Array Utility Functions (utils.js)

The following functions are implemented and reused across the project:

- `findMaxValueInArray(array)`  
  → Returns the maximum value in an array

- `findMinValueInArray(array)`  
  → Returns the minimum value in an array

- `findAverageValueInArray(array)`  
  → Returns the average value of elements in an array

These functions are imported into `main.js` using ES6 modules.

---

### Object Merging

Two objects are created:
- `person`
- `personAddress`

They are merged into a single object using the **spread operator (`...`)**, demonstrating modern object manipulation.
